according to cher, the stuff doesnt really need to be coherent. 
He just wants to check our technical skills.
He suggested making a form with validation (Important!).
standardise font size and whatever.

you can also use a card for images. Should be very very useful for ours specifically.
carouselle looks cool too. Can implement for the colour symbolism part.

Not sure if navbar would be a good idea. It doesn't seem necessary for our project.

do a recaptcha lol like those I'm not a robot checkboxes.

oh yeah add a table. It's compulsory.
I guess you can put in a table at the bottom of the symbols page. Like, as a recap thingy.

I'm trying to think of where to add a form. That'll be a bit weird to add, but cher did 
say it didn't hv to make sense.

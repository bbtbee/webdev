get the user to upload a photo for the background of the website.
Since we're working with colours, we can try to have the photo change colours.

2 settings to consider:
colour
opacity

to obtain the values for these 2 variables, it should be relatively simple to just use a slider and colour picker 
in HTMl. The hard part comes when we want to actually change the colours. Not sure how to do that.
artisctically, it should be fairly simple. just fill a colour layer with the selected colour and change to opacity
accordingly.

OH maybe we can have the user upload a photo and then have 3 or 6 sliders to hv them change the hsv.
options:
third party software
find a js function that can somehow manipulate images

Nah i dont think that's gna work.

How bout this:
We animate like 8 or so circles using css in the background. Make like a 20 second loop or smt.
Then after the quiz, we hv an extra page where you get colour boxes to change the circles. I think
the only manageable way for that to work is to hv smt like 
circle 1:
<colour box>
circles 2:

etc etc

to make sure the user knows which box is which, we can get the circles to have black borders when the user
hovers over the colour box.

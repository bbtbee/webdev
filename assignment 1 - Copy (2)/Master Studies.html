      <p>Now it's time to analyse some colour from professional artists and see
        what we've learnt come into play</p>

          <p id="rex">In this painting, Ross uses mainly red, green, blue and a
           little bit of yellow. Hence, a mostly triadic colour scheme is used here,
           although you could argue that it's
           also technically a tetradic scheme.
          The bright, saturated green energy beams are contrasted by the black shapes beside it,
          making it a visually interesting part of the image.</p>

          <img src="pics\parade+final+lr (1).jpg" alt="" id="jaimepic">
          
          <p id="jex">The major colours here are white, red, green, and a bit of blue for the sky.
            A mostly complimentary scheme using red and green is used, with extra colours thrown in
            across the picture.
          The value structure of the peice helps to pull the focus on the front line of soldiers,
        with their bright armour in the light.</p>

          <p id="cex">While it's still visually complex, the colour scheme for this picture
          is monochromatic, using mostly only reds and greys. This goes to show that you don't need
        complicated schemes to have a good visual image. Most of the image is driven by Craig Mullin's
      shapes and values.</p>

          <p id="eex">To spice it up a little, I've decided to inclue a comercial character too. Otho is
          a textbook example of a complimentary colour scheme. What's important here is that the two colours
        don't clash with each other, which is done here by keeping the blues dark adn the yellows light.</p>
